Advent of Code 2022 solutions

## Basic assumptions

- I use standard GHC libraries only
- every hs file is a standalone solution (e.g. "1b.hs" refers to the second part of task 1)
- input is read from file given as an argument (e.g. ```./1b inputFile```)
- different approaches: while I try not to implement naive solutions, I sometimes give up the optimum one for the sake of a shorter and more elegant implemenentation; at times I will overengineer and use constructs that I find interesting

## Explanations of the solutions
